# JavaScript Practice

This repository contains challenges to complete each week. We'll be checking over your solutions regularly and you can always come to us if you are having any trouble.

### Instructions

Fork this repository to your own Github account.

Then clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/js_practice_feb2020.git

Change into the new directory

    cd javascript_practice

We will be adding more tasks to this repository as the weeks progress, so you'll need to pull in updates that _we_ make to this repository week by week. To do this, you need to link the original Tech Returners Github repository to your local repository on your machine.

To do this, running the following command:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/techreturners/js_practice_feb2020.git

This means that there will be links established between:

- Your local repository ---> Your repository on Github (called "origin")
- Your local repository ---> Our repository on Github (called "upstream")
